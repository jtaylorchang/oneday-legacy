OneDay was a mobile app I built in High School that was used over 300,000 times in the 4 years it was the official scheduling service of Nashoba Regional High School. This code was written when I was first learning app and server development and is here only for posterity.

- admin: the admin console built in `angular` with version 2 of the Ionic Framework
- announcements: the announcements management page for the high school administration to use
- mobile: the iOS and Android app built in `angular` with version 2 of the Ionic Framework
- server: the `PHP` backend
